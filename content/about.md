Head of Learning and Developer Advocate for NuxtJS with over 10 years experience in Frontend development.

I have a special love for JavaScript frameworks especially Vue.js and Nuxt.js and improving performance with webpack and of course the Jamstack. I hold a Frontend and FullStack Tech Degree and am Microsoft certified. I am an international speaker and I contribute to open source. I am a teacher at [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/courses/internationalization-with-vue-i18n) as well as [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/get-started-with-nuxt) and I am a writer for Ultimate Courses.
